# Retrospective - Epic 1: Hands-Free Voice Coaching

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Participants:** Roy (Project Lead), Bob (Scrum Master), John (Product Manager), Amelia (Developer), Murat (QA), Winston (Architect)

## Epic Summary

Epic 1 transformed the silent visual timer into an audible coach, enabling hands-free workouts. The team delivered a robust `SpeechService` wrapper, a user-facing `VoiceToggle`, and integrated audio announcements into the `WorkoutPlayer`.

**Delivery Metrics:**
- **Completed:** 3/3 stories (100%)
- **Velocity:** Consistent; no major blockers.
- **Quality:** High test coverage (Unit + Integration). Zero critical bugs reported.

## Key Insights & Learnings

1.  **TDD Reduces Integration Friction:** Writing integration tests for `WorkoutPlayer` *before* implementation in Story 1.3 significantly clarified the complex `useEffect` logic and reduced defects.
    *   **Action:** Adopt TDD/Test-First for complex logic in future stories.
2.  **Interface Definition Enables Parallelism:** Identifying loosely coupled components (like Service vs. UI) early allows for parallel story execution.
    *   **Action:** Evaluate Epic 2 stories for parallel execution opportunities.
3.  **State Management Evolution:** Component-local state is great for isolation but often needs lifting for orchestration. Story 1.3 required refactoring 1.2's local state to a shared hook.
    *   **Action:** Anticipate state lifting during architecture reviews for integration points.

## Action Items & Commitments

These items are effectively "persisted" here and will be referenced by agents in future story creations.

1.  **Linearizer Regression Tests (High Priority):**
    *   **Context:** Epic 2 requires modifying the core `linearizer` logic.
    *   **Action:** Create "Golden Master" snapshots of linearizer output *before* modifying logic in Story 2.1.
    *   **Owner:** Developer Agent (first task of Story 2.1).

2.  **Parallel Execution Strategy:**
    *   **Context:** Story 2.2 (UI) and 2.3 (Next Up) rely on 2.1 (Logic) but are independent of each other.
    *   **Action:** Schedule 2.2 and 2.3 to potentially run in parallel once 2.1 is stable.

## Epic 2 Readiness

The team is cleared to proceed with **Epic 2: Intelligent Block Rest**.
- **Prerequisites:** None blocking start.
- **First Step:** Story 2.1 will begin with regression snapshot creation.
